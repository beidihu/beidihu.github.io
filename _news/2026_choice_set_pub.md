Our paper, ["Choice Set Size Neglect in Predicting Others' Preferences"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976251400333)(in collaboration with Alice Moon and Eric VanEpps), is now published online at Psychological Science (Open Access). Although every choice comes with a set size, we find that people consistently underestimate how it influences others’ preferences when observing their choices.
