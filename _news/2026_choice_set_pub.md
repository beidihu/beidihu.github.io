Excited to see my paper "Choice Set Size Neglect in Predicting Others' Preferences" (in collaboration with Alice Moon and Eric VanEpps) published online today at Psychological Science! [[Open Access link](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976251400333)] Although every choice comes with a set size, we find that people consistently underestimate how it influences others’ preferences when observing their choices.
