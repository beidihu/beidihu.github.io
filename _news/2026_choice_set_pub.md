Our paper, ["Choice Set Size Neglect in Predicting Others' Preferences"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976251400333) (in collaboration with Alice Moon and Eric VanEpps), is now published online at Psychological Science (Open Access). 
Imagine watching a friend order chocolate ice cream every time you go to the same small corner store. Would you conclude that chocolate is their favorite flavor? Now imagine going with them to a shop with dozens of flavors, where they still choose chocolate. Although that choice is the same, its meaning is not. This paper examines a simple mistake we often make when interpreting others’ choices: we focus on what they choose and overlook how many alternatives they had. Choosing an option from a smaller set conveys much less information about one's preference than choosing the same option from a larger set (this is mathematically true). Yet observers tend to underweight the choice context and treat these choices as almost equally revealing.
