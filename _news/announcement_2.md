Our paper titled "Different Methods Elicit Different Belief Distributions" (in collaboration with Joe Simmons, part of my dissertation work) is published online today at the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General [[Journal link](https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xge0001655)]. Belief distribution elicitations are on the rise across disciplines. We find that two functionally equivalent methods (Distribution Builder and Sliders) elicit different belief distributions.
