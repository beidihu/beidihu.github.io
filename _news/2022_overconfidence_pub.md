Our paper titled "Does Constructing a Belief Distribution Truly Reduce Overconfidence?" (in collaboration with Joe Simmons, based on my dissertation work) is published online today at the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General [[Journal link](https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0001291)][[Ungated link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VQeJd3eVyDd2tWwKvoVtk_wrmSZqFO6C/view?usp=sharing)]. Past work says yes. Our paper finds the opposite.
