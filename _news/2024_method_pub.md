Our paper, ["Different Methods Elicit Different Belief Distributions"](https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xge0001655) (in collaboration with Joe Simmons, part of my dissertation work), is now published online at the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General [[Ungated link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ICWKU2mY7NsI6m6bhYRP2AUKXPzTm7J6/view?usp=sharing)]. Belief distribution elicitations are on the rise across disciplines. We find that two functionally equivalent methods (Distribution Builder and Sliders) elicit different belief distributions.
