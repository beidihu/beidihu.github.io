Our paper titled "How Should Time Estimates Be Structured to Increase Customer Satisfaction?" (in collaboration with Celia Gaertig and Berkeley Dietvorst) is published online today at Management Science [[Open Access link](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00137)]. We find that customers judge a digital platform (e.g., food delivery app, GPS app) more positively when it provides time estimates as ranges rather than point estimates.
