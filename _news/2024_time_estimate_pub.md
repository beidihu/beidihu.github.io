Our paper, ["How Should Time Estimates Be Structured to Increase Customer Satisfaction?"](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00137) (in collaboration with Celia Gaertig and Berkeley Dietvorst), is now published online at Management Science (Open Access). We find that customers judge a digital platform (e.g., food delivery app, GPS app) more positively when it provides time estimates as ranges rather than point estimates.
