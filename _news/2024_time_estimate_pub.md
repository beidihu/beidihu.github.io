Our paper, ["How Should Time Estimates Be Structured to Increase Customer Satisfaction?"](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00137) (in collaboration with Celia Gaertig and Berkeley Dietvorst), is now published online at Management Science (Open Access). Imagine being told your food will arrive in 45 minutes and watching the clock as it’s late, vs. being told 40–50 minutes and getting the same outcome. Nothing about the delivery has changed, but the experience, in particular, your satisfaction often has. This paper examines how precise time estimates can backfire in inherently uncertain settings: point estimates create narrow expectations that can be easily violated, while ranges prepare people for future variability. When uncertainty is unavoidable, how time is communicated can matter as much as when the outcome occurs.
