Hello! I am an [Assistant Professor of Marketing](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/h/beidi-hu) at the [University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/). 

My research examines how people form and represent beliefs under uncertainty, and how these beliefs shape their judgments and decisions, with applications to consumer choices, forecasting, and managerial decision-making. My work has been published in various outlets, including <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</em>, <em>Management Science</em>, and <em>Psychological Science</em>. Learn more about my research [here](https://www.beidihu.com/publications/). 

At Booth, I teach Marketing Strategy to MBA students.<sup>1</sup>

I received my Ph.D. in [Decision Processes](https://oid.wharton.upenn.edu/programs/phd/) at [the Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/), University of Pennsylvania. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my B.A. summa cum laude in [Philosophy, Politics, and Economics](https://ppe.sas.upenn.edu/) from the University of Pennsylvania.
