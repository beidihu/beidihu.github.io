# Hello!
I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. 
I am broadly interested in consumer behavior and judgment and decision-making, in particular, how consumers and marketers make decisions under uncertainty. Thus far, I have sought to shed light on questions like: How can we get overconfident consumers to better appreciate uncertainty and the possibility that they might be wrong? How should companies best communicate the inherent uncertainty in their services (e.g., delivery estimates provided by food delivery apps)? Do consumers more highly value a good that they acquire from an uncertain process (e.g., from a lottery)? 
I received my Ph.D. in Decision Processes at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my B.A. summa cum laude in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the University of Pennsylvania.
